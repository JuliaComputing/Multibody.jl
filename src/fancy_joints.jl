Joint that has a spherical joint on each of its two ends. The rod connecting the two spherical joints is approximated by a point mass that is located in the middle of the rod. When the mass is set to zero (default), special code for a massless body is generated. 

This joint introduces one constraint defining that the distance between the origin of `frame_a` and the origin of `frame_b` is constant (= rodLength). It is highly recommended to use this joint in loops whenever possible, because this enhances the efficiency considerably due to smaller systems of non-linear algebraic equations.

It is not possible to connect other components, such as a body with mass properties or a special visual shape object to the rod connecting the two spherical joints. If this is needed, use instead joint [`UniversalSpherical`](@ref) that has the additional frame `frame_ia` for this.

Spherical cut joint and translational directions may be constrained or released

This model does not use explicit variables e.g. state variables in order to describe the relative motion of `frame_b` with to respect to `frame_a`, but defines kinematic constraints between the `frame_a` and `frame_b`. The forces and torques at both frames are then evaluated in such a way that the constraints are satisfied. Sometimes this type of formulation is also called an implicit joint in literature.

As a consequence of the formulation the relative kinematics between `frame_a` and `frame_b` cannot be initialized.

In complex multibody systems with closed loops this may help to simplify the system of non-linear equations. Please compare state realization chosen by `structural_simplify` using the classical joint formulation and the alternative formulation used here in order to check whether this fact applies to the particular system under consideration. In systems without closed loops the use of this implicit joint is not recommended.

Universal - spherical joint aggregation (1 constraint, no potential states)

This component consists of a universal joint at `frame_a` and a spherical joint at `frame_b` that are connected together with a rigid rod.

This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces the constraint that the distance between the origin of `frame_a` and the origin of `frame_b` is constant (= `length(rRod_ia)`). The universal joint is defined in the following way:
- The rotation axis of revolute joint 1 is along parameter vector `n1_a` which is fixed in `frame_a`.
- The rotation axis of revolute joint 2 is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint.

Note, there is a singularity when axis 1 and the connecting rod are parallel to each other. Therefore, if possible `n1_a` should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to `rRod_ia` in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the singularity is as large as possible).

An additional `frame_ia` is present. It is fixed in the connecting rod at the origin of `frame_a`. The placement of `frame_ia` on the rod is implicitly defined by the universal joint (`frame_a` and `frame_ia` coincide when the angles of the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by parameter vector `rRod_ia`, the position vector from the origin of `frame_a` to the origin of `frame_b`, resolved in `frame_ia`.

This joint aggregation can be used in cases where in reality a rod with spherical joints at end are present. Such a system has an additional degree of freedom to rotate the rod along its axis. In practice this rotation is usually of no interest and is mathematically removed by replacing one of the spherical joints by a universal joint. Still, in most cases the [`SphericalSpherical`](@ref) joint aggregation can be used instead of the UniversalSpherical joint since the rod is animated and its mass properties are approximated by a point mass in the middle of the rod. The [`SphericalSpherical`](@ref) joint has the advantage that it does not have a singular configuration.

# Arguments
- `n1_a` Axis 1 of universal joint resolved in frame_a (axis 2 is orthogonal to axis 1 and to rod)
- `rRod_ia` Vector from origin of frame_a to origin of frame_b, resolved in `frame_ia` (if computeRodLength=true, rRod_ia is only an axis vector along the connecting rod)
- `kinematic_constraint = true` Set to false if no constraint shall be defined, due to analytically solving a kinematic loop
- `constraint_residue` If set to `:external`, an equation in the parent system is expected to define this variable, e.g., `rod.constraint_residue ~ rod.f_rod - f_rod` where `rod` is the name of the UniversalSpherical joint. If unspecified, the length constraint `rRod_0'rRod_0 - rodLength'rodLength` is used

This component consists of a universal joint at `frame_a`, a revolute joint at `frame_b` and a spherical joint which is connected via rod1 to the universal and via rod2 to the revolute joint.

This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved analytically (i.e., a solution is always computed, if a unique solution exists).

The universal joint is defined in the following way:

- The rotation axis of revolute joint 1 is along parameter vector `n1_a` which is fixed in `frame_a`.
- The rotation axis of revolute joint 2 is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint (= rod 1).

The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed according to the most often occurring case for the sake of simplicity. Otherwise, the treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to the connecting rod.

Note, there is a singularity when axis 1 and the connecting rod are parallel to each other. Therefore, if possible `n1_a` should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the singularity is as large as possible).

The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following parameters:

- `positive_branch`: The positive branch of the revolute joint is selected (cf. elbow up vs. elbow down).
- The position of the spherical joint with respect to the universal joint is defined by vector `rRod1_ia`. This vector is directed from `frame_a` to the spherical joint and is resolved in `frame_ia` (it is most simple to select `frame_ia` such that it is parallel to `frame_a` in the reference or initial configuration).
- The position of the spherical joint with respect to the revolute joint is defined by vector `rRod2_ib`. This vector is directed from the inner frame of the revolute joint (`frame_ib` or `revolute.frame_a`) to the spherical joint and is resolved in `frame_ib` (note, that `frame_ib` and `frame_b` are parallel to each other).
- The axis of rotation of the revolute joint is defined by axis vector `n_b`. It is fixed and resolved in `frame_b`.
- When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions above, two different configurations are possible. Via parameter `phi_guess` a guess value for `revolute.phi(t0)` at the initial time `t0` is given. The configuration is selected that is closest to `phi_guess` (`|revolute.phi - phi_guess|` is minimal).

# Connectors
- `frame_a`: Frame for the universal joint
- `frame_b`: Frame for the revolute joint
- An additional `frame_ia` is present. It is fixed in the rod connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the origin of `frame_a`. The placement of `frame_ia` on the rod is implicitly defined by the universal joint (`frame_a` and `frame_ia` coincide when the angles of the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by parameter vector rRod1_ia, the position vector from the origin of `frame_a` to the spherical joint, resolved in `frame_ia`.
- An additional `frame_ib` is present. It is fixed in the rod connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side of the revolute joint that is connected to this rod (`= rod2.frame_a = revolute.frame_a`).
- An additional `frame_im` is present. It is fixed in the rod connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side of the spherical joint that is connected to this rod (`= rod2.frame_b`). It is always parallel to `frame_ib`.

This component consists of 3 revolute joints with parallel axes of rotation that are connected together by two rods.

This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state variables and should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever possible to avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only meaningful to use this component in planar loops. Basically, the position and orientation of the 3 revolute joints as well as of `frame_ia`, `frame_ib`, and `frame_im` are calculated by solving analytically a non-linear equation, given the position and orientation at `frame_a` and at `frame_b`.

Connector `frame_a` is the "left" side of the first revolute joint whereas `frame_ia` is the "right side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 1. Connector `frame_b` is the "right" side of the third revolute joint whereas `frame_ib` is the "left" side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 2. Finally, connector `frame_im` is the connector at the "right" side of the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2.

The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by moving the MultiBody system in a reference configuration where all frames of all components are parallel to each other (alternatively, at least `frame_a`, `frame_ia`, `frame_im`, `frame_ib`, `frame_b` of the JointRRR joint should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this component).

Basically, the JointRRR model internally consists of a universal-spherical-revolute joint aggregation (= JointUSR). In a planar loop this will behave as if 3 revolute joints with parallel axes are connected by rigid rods.
