# Pendulum---The "Hello World of multi-body dynamics"
This beginners tutorial will model a pendulum pivoted around the origin in the world frame. The world frame is a constant that lives inside the Multibody module, all multibody models are "grounded" in the same world. To start we load the packages
```@example pendulum
using ModelingToolkit
using Multibody
using Plots
```
We then access the world frame and time variable from the Multibody module
```@example pendulum
t = Multibody.t
world = Multibody.world
```
Our simple pendulum consists of a [`Body`](@ref) and a [`Revolute`](@ref) joint (the pivot joint). We construct these elements by calling their constructors
```
@named body = Body(; m=1, isroot=false)
@named joint = Multibody.Revolute(; Ï•0=1)
```
To connect the components together, we create a vector of connections using the `connect` function. A joint typically has two frames, `frame_a` and `frame_b. The first frame of the joint is attached to the world frame, and the body is attached to the second joint frame. The order of the connections is not important for ModelingToolkit, but it's good practice to follow some convention, here, we start at the world and progress outwards in the kinematic tree.
```@example pendulum
connections = [
    connect(world.frame_b, joint.frame_a)
    connect(joint.frame_b, body.frame_a)
]
```
With all components and connections defined, we can create an `ODESystem` like so:

```@example pendulum
@named model = ODESystem(connections, t, systems=[world, joint, body])
```

Before we can simulate the system, we must perform model compilation using [`structural_simplify`](@ref)

```@example pendulum
sys = structural_simplify(model)
```

We are now ready to create an `ODEProblem` and simulate it:
```@example pendulum
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [], (0.0, 10.0))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
plot(sol)
```
